<!-- About The Project -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F9D0 About the Project</strong></h2>
    <p>This project was created specifically to meet my needs after installing Manjaro on my computer. However, since the script I created was so good (at least for me), I decided that it was not fair to keep it just for myself. So I thought: "why not share it with the world?".</p>
    <p>I bet you must have already wasted a lot of time downloading all your programs again after formatting your PC, right? You need to download a more updated program and so on... YUCK!</p>
    <p>No more! Automate your processes and optimize your time! Let my script do all the work for you!</p>

<!-- Built With -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F6E0 Built With</strong></h2>

    </ul>

<!-- Getting Started -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F3C1 Getting Started</strong></h2>
    <p>This project contains two .sh files: <a href="https://github.com/vyujitanaka/Manjaro-Post-Install-Script/blob/master/1.Setup.sh">1.Setup.sh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vyujitanaka/Manjaro-Post-Install-Script/blob/master/2.Apps-to-Install.sh">2.Apps-to-Install.sh</a>.</p>
    <p>This means that you must first run the 1st file and then the 2nd.</p>

<!-- Prerequisites -->
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a computer with Manjaro distribution installed;</li>
        <li>Have basic knowledge of Linux;</li>
        <li>Basic familiarity with the Linux terminal;</li>
        <li>Internet access.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Usage Examples -->
### Usage
&#128073; First, [download](https://github.com/vyujitanaka/Manjaro-Post-Install-Script/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the files.

&#128073; Then extract the .sh files.

&#128073; After extracting the .sh files, first run the 1.Setup.sh script on your terminal.

&#9888; If you don't know how to run a .sh file on the terminal, click [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38661/how-do-i-run-sh-scripts).

&#128073; When the script is finished, restart your computer.

&#128073; After restarting your computer, run the 2.Apps-to-Install.sh script.

&#128073; When the 2nd script is finished, restart your PC again.

&#127881; That's it! Now just test the programs that were automatically downloaded to your computer!

### Notes
I recommend you run the scripts after you have freshly installed your manjaro-based operating system.

The scripts were created specifically to meet my needs. So, if you want to change them to suit yours and/or share them with others, you can according to the [license](https://github.com/vyujitanaka/Manjaro-Post-Install-Script#license) of this project.

Before running the scripts, I strongly recommend that you study them and observe what they will update/install on your computer.
